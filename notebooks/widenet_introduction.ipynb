The emphasis here is on **tool criticism** centring on a concrete case-study (the last part of the tutorial is more hands-on). More specifically, please reflect and discuss\n",

Also, assume you are a specialist in Canadian politics--this will help you considerably with understanding the data. If both features don’t apply to you--i.e. you are, like most present here, neither a historian nor knowledgeable about the peculiar constellation of Canadian party politics--have a quick look at the Wikipedia pages below.\n",

We prepared multiple WideNet queries based on the parliamentary data from Canada and the Netherlands. Of course, you can also compare specific queries.\n",

To avoid clicking through loads of speeches, it may help to formulate a question or hypothesis that will guide you when working your way through the data.

        "- When clicking through the categories, keep track of how your selection criteria (and thus your understanding of the concept under investigation) evolve. Is there any pattern in the entities that are informative?\n",
        "- Don’t forget to expand the “Not found” and “Other entities” tabs at the bottom left-hand side of the screen; assess the value of the missing entities, is their absence historically interesting, or just an artefact of the entity linker we used? You can independently interrogate the data using the political mashup search interface. \n",
        "- After selecting entities and categories, carefully inspect the individual documents that resulted from your previous choices. Please note that you can further refine the set of entities, by (de)selecting them. \n",
