# Part II: Exercise
## Exploring Complex Concepts with WideNet

### Aim of the exercise

The exercise session consists of a guided WideNet tutorial (ca. 25 minutes) followed by a short discussion (ca. 15 minutes). The aim of the tutorial is to get acquainted with the WideNet interface and learn to sculpt a corpus using a semantically enhanced exploratory search system.  The emphasis here is on **tool criticism** centring on a concrete case-study (the last part of the tutorial is more hands-on). More specifically, please reflect and discuss

- How the interface and workflow **support historical research**, i.e. to what extent do the affordances of the interface enable (or complicate) the process of iterative concept definition and corpus building?
- How the focus on entities contributes to delineating **colligatory concepts**?
- How the **presence (or absence) of specific entities** can be explained in the light of everything you know about entity linking?
- How the process of source selection resembles that of **gathering expert annotations**? What can be done with the output of these annotations in terms of concept definition, and constructing knowledge bases?

### Step-by-step

Imagine you are a historian (if you are already a historian, just stay who you are) who wants to investigate how parliamentarians have made use of history in their speeches. Also, assume you are a specialist in Canadian politics--this will help you considerably with understanding the data. If both features don’t apply to you--i.e. you are, like most present here, neither a historian nor knowledgeable about the peculiar constellation of Canadian party politics--have a quick look at the Wikipedia pages listed in this footnote.
	
- Select a topic of interest from the demo site or from this footnote (if you know Dutch). We prepared multiple WideNet queries based on the parliamentary data from Canada and the Netherlands. Of course, you can also compare specific queries.
- Behind each of these queries hide a substantial number of speeches. To avoid clicking through loads of speeches, it may help to formulate a question or hypothesis that will guide you when working your way through the data. Put differently, before you start, try to come up with a set of guidelines that explicate your “aboutness” criteria for individual documents.
- After selecting the target query, the preview stage opens. As told during the presentation, here you can assess the relevance of each category as a whole, and/or refine the selection by included (or discarding) specific entities. 
- Experiment with selecting and deselecting categories and entities. The concordances located at the centre of the screen provide minimal context to help you make an informed decision. 
- When clicking through the categories, keep track of how your selection criteria (and thus your understanding of the concept under investigation) evolve. Is there any pattern in the entities that are informative?
- Don’t forget to expand the “Not found” and “Other entities” tabs at the bottom left-hand side of the screen; assess the value of the missing entities, is their absence historically interesting, or just an artefact of the entity linker we used? You can independently interrogate the data using the political mashup search interface. 
- After selecting entities and categories, carefully inspect the individual documents that resulted from your previous choices. Please note that you can further refine the set of entities, by (de)selecting them. 
- At the end of the road, store the data as JSON (click “Relevant Speeches”)! You will need this for later.

### Discussion

Please reflect on the questions below:

- How helpful is the entity-based exploratory search for exploring complex concepts? What type of information becomes visible, which parts of the corpus remain in the dark? 
- How does the interface tie in with the iterative, and often messy, research process common in the humanities? To what extent does it facilitate the process of exploration and selection? What functionality should be added? Which changes should be made?
- What to do with the result of the query process? What can be done with the annotations?
